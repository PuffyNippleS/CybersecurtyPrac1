# CybersecurtyPrac1
In this project, we're combining the ancient practice of steganography, which involves hiding information in plain sight, with cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Augmented Reality adds a digital layer to our physical world, incorporating visuals, sound, and sensory elements through technology. Our goal is to create an AR application that securely conceals sensitive content like videos or audio files. This hidden content can only be unlocked when viewed through a specific AR marker, which will be shared exclusively with the intended recipient.
