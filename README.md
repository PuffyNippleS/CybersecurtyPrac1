Steganography, the art of concealing information within non-secret mediums, meets the innovative realm of Augmented Reality (AR) in this project. Augmented Reality enhances the real world by overlaying digital elements, such as visuals, sound, or sensory cues, through technology. This project aims to develop an AR application that hides sensitive information like videos or audio files, only accessible when viewed through a specific AR marker shared with the receiver.
