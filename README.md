# CybersecurtyPrac1
In this project, we're combining the ancient practice of steganography, which involves hiding information in plain sight, with cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Augmented Reality adds a digital layer to our physical world, incorporating visuals, sound, and sensory elements through technology. Our goal is to create an AR application that securely conceals sensitive content like videos or audio files. This hidden content can only be unlocked when viewed through a specific AR marker, which will be shared exclusively with the intended recipient.

# Scenario
You are a member of a clandestine group that specializes in covert communication techniques. To amplify the security and intrigue of your exchanges, you've decided to combine the age-old art of steganography with cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Through a custom AR application, your group can now share hidden video messages within innocuous-looking images.
